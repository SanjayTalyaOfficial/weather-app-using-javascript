# weather-app-using-javascript
This a small javascript experiment to check the weather across the world. It has a simple interface.

In this project i have used OpenWeatherMap API which is freely available. Just that you have to sign up and head over to the API Keys section where youll find your api key waiting to be used.

I have also inserted the respective images after modification, which i have mentioned as version 1, version 2 and so on
